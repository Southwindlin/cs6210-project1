/****

I think virNodeGetCPUMap gives us a map of all CPUs on the host that are online. It's a bitmap,
so...

 CPU0-7, 8-15... In each byte, lowest CPU number is least significant bit.

 On my physical desktop I have 4 CPU cores, so I think this will look like

 00001111
 0xF

 Which is what I'm getting.

 The above has capacity for 8 CPUs though. Need to generalize. 




 Two strategies I see for balancing workload across pCPUs.
 The instructor said we can assume no other large workloads
 will be happening on host, so we can assume that virtual 
 CPU time reported by domains is roughly the total load
 on physical CPUs.


 Approach 1:

 Try to balance the number of vCPUs pinned to each pCPU. 
 The vCPU<->pCPU mapping is found using virDomainGetVcpus().

 Approach 2:

 Try to balance the vCPU time usage across pCPUs. This will 
require me to assign a weight to each vCPU. 

virVcpuInfo struct gives vCPU's pCPU number and pCPU time used in nanoseconds. 
If I iterate over all vCPUs and create a map of pCPUs and the time used on them,
I can determine which pCPUs are being underutilized by the guests.
I can then choose a pCPU to give more work to. 



 "where every pCpu handles similar amount of workload."
 "Once the VMs enter into the stable/balanced state, your program shouldnâ€™t do additional jobs."
 So if the CPUs are balanced, don't re-balance them. Define what "balanced" looks like. 
Take average of all pCPUs, then iterate again and find the one most out of bounds.
If they're all within 10% of avg or something they're "balanced".
We don't have unique IDs for vCPUs, but we have a key such as
domainname+vCPUNumber. string array?

Balancing:
If average pCPU usage is lower than all vCPU CPU time stats, then we're balanced.

If any vCPU CPU time stat is higher than (10%?) the average, unbalanced. 


What if multiple vCPUs get pinned to a pCPU, but other pCPUs are open?

10 5 0 0

avg: 15/4 = 3.75

10 > (3.75 + (3.75*20)), unbalanced.

What if # of pCPUs >> vCPUs?

5 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 avg: 15/16 = .937
 5 > (.937 + (.937 * .20))...unbalanced. but it should be balanced. 

 If ANY pCPU has more than one vCPU AND there are empty pCPUs, unbalanced. 
 That handles it. I've seen this in the wild where both vCPUs are pinned
 to pCPU 0. Is that a special case? Is the balancing algorithm:

 1. Distribute vCPUs such that every vCPU has its own dedicated pCPU.
 2. When pCPUs are full, then distribute based on execution time.
    For each pCPU that has > 1 vCPU:
     a. Find a new place for the vCPU (the pCPU with the smallest CPU time usage)
     b. Pin the vCPU to that new pCPU.
